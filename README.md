NSS-Cal
=======

Calendar project for the Nashville Software School
This program is designed to use TDD while developing a Ruby program equivalent to Unix Cal. 
It should display a calendar including the days of the month between years 1800 and 3000 with leap years and other irregularities taken into consideration. 
The result should look just like the output from Unix Cal.
